                      PROFILE OPERATION

Display the profile of an image along a row or a column. A 
display menu allows the setting of different options.
The profile can be displayed temporarily or permanently on 
the screen.  The profile can be normalized relative to 
original image or relative to its row (column).  The row or 
column where the profile is taken is indicated by a line over 
the image and by its row or column number.
