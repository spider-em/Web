                                   WEB

INTRODUCTION

WEB is a graphical user interface for displaying and interacting with SPIDER
images developed at the Biological Microscopy and Image Reconstruction Resource
(BMIRR) located in the Wadsworth Laboratories, Albany, New York. WEB is written
in C and runs under the X/Motif system. WEB was developed by A. Leith with
contributions from L. Odesanya, Y.H. Li, M. Ladjadj, A. Dent, M. Radermacher,
and J. Frank. WEB has been in use since 1990 and contains more than 35,000
lines of code.

VARIABLE INITIALIZATION

Certain variables in Web can be initialized from the command line or in Xt
resource files.

   *  COMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS
   *  Xt RESOURCES

OPERATIONS

Operations are grouped under five main menu headings: OPTIONS, COMMANDS, EDIT,
INFO, SYSTEM

   *  "OPTIONS" alter the way information is diplayed during a WEB session.
   *  "COMMANDS" provide the main display and analysis of 2D & 3D images.
   *  "EDIT" provides further commands which edit 2D or 3D images.
   *  "INFO" provides information on workstation and WEB capabilities.
   *  "SYSTEM" provides settings for file searching and for stopping the
              application.

Operations are selected by pointing at the relevant menu heading and then
selecting the menu sub-option (and sub-sub-option) using the left mouse button.

   *  OPTIONS
        o  Image
           Alters image display charactaristics:
             + left & top margin around image display area
             + X & Y margin around each image
             + size reduction for image display (-2 is a magnification of 2X)
             + montage movie flag (keeps next image in same location as current
               image)
             + list file names below images
             + start new row or screen of images
             + toggle for listing files in file-selector (toggle off if you
               have hundreds of files!).
        o  Contrast
           Enhances contrast of image using thresholding.
        o  Cursor
           Selects cursor style from a pallette.
        o  Display
           Turns off scrolling text window.
        o  Font
           Selects font for drawing text.
        o  Magnify
           Sets magnification area and magnification factor.
        o  Color
          Selects color for graphics characteristics:
             +  Foreground -- color for following graphics
             +  Background -- image & graphics surround
             +  Overlay -- overlay color (for masking)
             +  Cursor -- cursor colors.
        o  Line Style
           Alters line style (in some operations only).
        o  Line Width
           Alters line width (in some operations only).
        o  Lut
           Applies a color look-up table to current screen.
   *  COMMANDS
        o  Clear
           Clears screen.
        o  Image
           Shows an image. Will try to place the image on the screen so that it
           does not overlap previous images.
        o  Montage
           Shows a montage of 2-D images or 3-D slices. Use the movie toggle in
           the Image Option menu to force all images to be displayed at the same
           location.
        o  Surface
           Does fast surface display of 3D file. User specifies surface level
           and relative contribution from depth and surface reflectivity. The
           movie option allows the creation of several files representing
           individual frames, which can then be played back as a movie. User can
           specifies the rotation angles to rotate the volume. This rotation can
           be done according to the original system or the current system.
        o  Shift
           Pans previously displayed image within its original display area. Can
           be used for images too large for the WEB window.
        o  Annotate
           Draws circles and numerical labels on top of an image. Positions for
           circles and values for labels are read from a SPIDER document file.
           User can specify registers for x & y coordinates and label.
        o  Blackout
           Blacks out screen margins. (You may have to maximize the display
           window before selecting this option on some machines).
        o  Categorize
           Displays montage of images. Asks for new SPIDER document file name.
           User can assign a category to each image using mouse to select
           images. The category is toggled using the middle mouse button.
           Categories and file numbers are stored in a document file.
        o  Colored Surface
           Does fast surface display of 3D file. Colors surface according to
           values found in a second 3D file. Specify surface level, contribution
           from depth and surface reflectivity, and number of colors. The values
           in the color volume are divided into the specified number of colors.
           A private color-map can be used to alter the correspondence between
           colors and intensities in the color volume. Can only handle less than
           six colors. Further details.
        o  Convolve
           Does some discrete convolutions on an image. Further details.
        o  Corr-map
           Displays correspondance map. Can then outline areas and query images
           found within areas.  Further details.
        o  Dendrogram
           Performs a "dendrogram" plot with input taken from a SPIDER document
           file. Can also display the averaged images of a given threshold
           setting.
        o  Distance
           Interactively queries a pair of pixel locations to determine their
           separation distance. Can record distances in a document file. Can
           record up to six distances from each starting point on a line of the
           document file.
        o  Histogram
           Draws image histogram on screen.
        o  Magnify
           Interactively magnifies an area of the screen.
        o  Markers
           Interactively selects marker locations and stores locations relative
           to image in a SPIDER document file. Can edit marker selections before
           they are stored.   Further details.
        o  Mask
           Interactively draws polygons on screen to make a binary mask image.
           The mask image is stored in a file. This mask file can then be used
           in SPIDER for masking a grey scale image by multiplication.
        o  Particles
           Interactively selects coordinates from an untilted/tilted pair of
           micrographs, determines tilt angle and tilt-axis direction by a
           least-sqare fit of all selected particle locations. Further details.
        o  Pixel
           Queries a pixel for location and color. Can place pixel location,
           color index value, or file value in a document file. Color of marker
           for location is controlled by previous color foreground selection
           operation.
        o  Power Spectrum
           Shows a power spectrum of enclosed area in a user drawn window. The
           spectrum is from screen data not file data. Does not work for some
           window sizes.
        o  Profile
           Displays the profile of an image along a row or column.  Further details..
        o  Reflections
           Interactively picks reflections from a diffraction pattern and places
           indices and locations in a document file.
        o  Record Screen
           Records an area of screen in a SPIDER image file.
        o  Show Recording
           Shows a screen recording (including color) made with the Record
           Screen operation.
        o  Show Contourfile
           Displays a contour metafile.
        o  SIRDS
           Creates and displays a "single image relative displacement
           stereogram" from a volume.
   *  EDIT
        o  Bars
           Draws horizontal or vertical bars on screen using previously set
           foreground color.
        o  Lines
           Draws lines on screen using previously set foreground color.
        o  Text
           Draws text on screen using previously set foreground color.
        o  Draw Boxes
           Draws boxes on screen using previously set foreground color.
        o  Move Area
           Moves or copies an area of the screen from one position to another.
           Useful also for editing labels, etc. for photography.
        o  Window Last File
           Interactively windows a displayed file and saves window from original
           file in a new SPIDER image file.
        o  Drill-n-fill
           Interactively edits a volume while viewing a surface view of volume.
           Volume is viewed along X axis. Surface view is same as surface
           operation. Mouse buttons control movement of a tool which drills or
           fills areas of the volume. Further details.
   *  INFO
        o  X info
