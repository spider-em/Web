   &nbsp;&nbsp;  Web: Drill-n-fill 
</h1> 
<p><hr /> <p>

Displays a surface view of a SPIDER volume using the same algorithm as
the "Surface" operation.  The volume is viewed along the X axis from
the "left" side.  The user sets the threshold where the displayed
surface is located, and the percent influence of reflectivity and depth on
the rendering.  After the surface is rendered, another menu appears 
where the can user set parameters for the drilling tool.  These
parameters include: The density which is given to drilled/filled voxels;
the depth, width, and length of the drilling tool; and the movement 
increment for 
the drilling tool when the middle mouse button is pressed. <p> 
 
The tool edits an 8 bit volume which corresponds to the input volume.
The input volume densities are mapped over the range 1..254 in the
editable volume.  If the user wishes to add
densities to the editable volume which are never found otherwise in the
volume he/she can set the tool density value to 0 or 255.  <p>

     The left mouse button replaces the voxels starting at the current 
depth with voxels of the specified density.  All voxels within the
tool dimension are replaced.  The middle mouse button moves the tool
by one movement increment on each push.  Note that the movement 
increment can be poisitive or negative.   The right button sets the
current depth of the tool to the depth of the threshold surface at
that cursor location. <p>

After modifying the editable volume with the drill/fill tool the
user can save the volume in an SPIDER format output file.  The density 
values in the output file will be in the range 1..254 (unless the 
user set values of 0 or 255).  <p>

     This is an experimental operation and will only be improved or
enhanced if there is sufficent user demand.  Magnification of the 
surface view is not provided due to ambiguities which would arise
in the editting.  If you wish a magnified view use voxel replication
on the SPIDER volume before starting this operation.
