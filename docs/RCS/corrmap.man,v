                        CORRMAP OPERATION

Displays a correspondence map containing numerical labels
for images on the screen. The user can then draw a polygon 
around a group of images and display, or store in a file, 
the average image created from the grouped set of images.  
The average image display can be temporary or permanent. 

Input to this command is a document file and a number of 
images.  The document file is created by copying the 
IMC*** file (from correspondance analysis) to a document 
format using the SPIDER command: 'SD C'.
