<h3>Montage of Images From Document File</h3>

Displays montage of individule or stacked images, where the image numbers are obtained from
a SPIDER document file. <p>

Web asks for selection document file name.
A selection document file  
contains the image numbers in the first register (not in the key).  <p>

Then Web asks for: <br />
The Image file template, which is the template for
the series of files whose numbers are listed in the selection document
file (e.g.: AVG***)  This operation can also show a montage of images
from a stack file with the appropriate template (e.g. stackfile@@***).
<p>

One can optionally : 
<ul>
<li> Limit the range of images selected from the
     document file. </li><p>

<li>Specify starting location for the first image. </li><p>

<li>Specify number of frames (images) displayed on a row. </li><p>

<li>Request a "movie" in which case the images are displayed
    on top of each other. </li><p>

<li>Request creation of an averaged image of the series, 
    specifying  an output file name for the average image.<p>
</ul>

Displays montage of images.  The montage is taken from a selection 
document file list. Web Asks for document file name.  The document file
     must have the image numbers in the first register (not in the key).
     Then Web asks for the Image file template, which is the
     template for the series of files whose numbers are listed in
     the selection document file e.g.: AVG***  
     One can optionally
     specify the starting location for the first image and the
     number of frames (images) displayed on a row. The user can
     request a "movie" in which case the images are displayed on
     top of each other.  The user can also request creation of
     an averaged image of the series, If this is requested, Web
     will then neeed an output file name for the average image.
