**[Web](https://spider-em.github.io/Web)** is a graphical user interface for displaying and interacting with 
[SPIDER](https://spider-em.github.io/SPIDER) format images. 
These images are a standard image format often used for biological electron
microscopy,  especially for single-particle reconstruction.    

This repository holds *Web* source code and documentation including 50,000 lines of code.   Releases which contain both *SPIDER* and *Web* software are [available](https://github.com/spider-em/SPIDER/releases)   on Github.
