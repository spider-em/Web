<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION </a></h2>

<strong>JWeb</strong></a> is a graphical point-and-click user interface for displaying 
and interacting with <a href="../../spider/docs/master.html"> 
<i>SPIDER </i></a> 
images developed at the <b>Resource for the Visualization of Biological
complexity </b> 
(<a href="http://www.wadsworth.org/rvbc/index.html ">RVBC</a>) 
located in the Wadsworth Laboratories,
Albany, New York.  <i>JWeb </i> is written in "JAVA" using Java Advance Imaging (JAI)
and runs under the <i> LINUX</i>, <i> WINDOWS</i> and <i> IRIX</i> systems.  
<i>JWeb </i> was developed by Dr. Bimal Rath and contains more than 16,000 lines 
of code.
</p>

<p>

<H2><A NAME="OVERVIEW">OVERVIEW </a></H2>

To visualize and analyze SPIDER images using JWeb, the implemented operations have been 
divided into three categories e.g.
<ol>
 1) operations permitted on a single image <br>
 2) operations permitted on a set of images <br>
 3) operations permitted on a volume <br>
</ol> 
The relevant available operations are accessible after the desired image or 
image series or the volume is opened.
<p>

</p>
The opening GUI of JWeb contains menus to open a 2D image, or a series of 2D images 
or a volume. Output message window is also contained within it. 
<p>

</p>
Two different kinds of parameter settings have been implemented in JWeb. One is, 
"Global Settings" and the other is "Local Settings". By using the "Options" menu 
in the opening GUI of JWeb, "Global Settings" can be set. As a result of which, all
images displayed there after will have the same size and same contrast range.
However, each image object will have an EDIT menu which can be used to override the 
global settings. 
</p>


<p>

In most cases, in a JWeb GUI, when a desired option is selected by clicking on a 
check box or clicking on a radio button, the relevant sub-options are enabled and the 
rest are disabled.
</p>

<h2><a name="OPERATIONS">OPERATIONS </a></h2>

As described earlier, the Operations are grouped under 3 main categories:  
	  <a href="#Image Operations">Image Operations</a>, 
	  <a href="#Image Series Operations">Image Series Operations</a>, 
	  <a href="#Volume Operations">Volume Operations</a>, 

<ul>    
<li> <strong><A NAME="Image Operations"> Image Operations</a></strong>
<ul><p>		
<li><dt><strong>File</strong></dt>
<dl>     Saves file in the following formats (Saves the  gray scale value) :
            <ul>
            <li>SPIDER
            <li>RAW
            <li>BMP
            <li>JPEG 
            <li>PNG
            <li>PNM
            <li>TIFF
            </ul>
</dl><p>


<li><dt><strong>EDIT</strong></dt>
<dl>     Manipulates the image using following sub-menus:
            <ul>
            <li>TRANSLATE : moves the image in X and Y direction
            <li>RESIZE    : changes the display size of the image  
            <li>CONTRAST  : changes the contrast of the image
            <li>WINDOW    : can window an image using options, (1) Interactive, 
	    (2) Fixed Size, and (3) Specified Co-ordinate 
            </ul>
</dl>

<li><dt><strong>ANALYSIS</strong></dt>
<dl>     Analyses and manipulates the image using following sub-menus:
            <ul>
            <li>PIXEL : outputs (1) Screen Value, (2) File Value. Can draw markers.
	    Information about the pixel value and X,Y position of the marker can be 
	    written to a SPIDER document file.
            <li>ANNOTATE    : Reads a SPIDER document file and draws markers at the positions
	    read from the document file.  
            <li>MARKER  : Draws markers on an image and writes the positional infomation on to a 
	    SPIDER document file. Used for marker picking for Tomography purposes.
            <li>HISTOGRAM    : Displays histogram of the image.
            <li>DISTANCE  : Sets of distances from connecting points OR sets of distances from a 
	    single point on the image can be measured. Relevant information can be saved onto
	    a document file.
            <li>MASK    : A mask can be created interactively by using this menu.	    
	    
            </ul>
</dl>
</ul>
</p>


<li> <strong><A NAME="Image Series Operations">Image Series Operations</a></strong> 
<ul>
<li><dt><strong>MONTAGE </strong></dt>
<dl>     Displays a series of image as montage. The image series can be treated as 
         a volume by clicking on the "Treat as Volume" check box (The images are treated 
	 as Z-slices of the volume). </dl><p>

<li><dt><strong>SLIDE </strong></dt>
<dl>     Shows individual images in a single image window. Images are updated by 
         moving a slider in the GUI. The image series can be treated as 
         a volume by clicking on the "Treat as Volume" check box (The images are treated 
	 as Z-slices of the volume).  </dl><p>

<li><dt><strong>MOVIE </strong></dt>
<dl>    Shows a movie of the images in "one-way" or "two-way" mode. Delay time can be set
        using a slider. The image series can be treated as a volume by clicking on the
	"Treat as Volume" check box (The images are treated as Z-slices of the volume). 
	</dl><p>


<li><dt><strong>CATEGORIZE</strong></dt>
<dl>    Mostly used to pick particles for single particle reconstruction work. There 
        are two ways one can pick particles. 1) Pick Individual Particles - By clicking on individual images to select
	particles, 2) Pick A Set of Particles - By clicking on the first and last image of a stretch of good particles.
	</a>.</dl><p>

<li><dt><strong>MARKERS</strong></dt>
<dl>    Mostly used to pick markers for tomographic reconstruction work. Markers on a
        series of images are picked and the co-ordinates are saved onto a SPIDER document 
	file. Deleting, moving and renumbering of markers can be easily accomplished.
	 </dl></ul></p>



<li> <strong><A NAME="Volume Operations">Volume Operations</a></strong> 
<ul>
<li><dt><strong>MONTAGE  </strong></dt>
<dl>     Displays slices of the volume as montage. </dl><p>

<li><dt><strong>SLICER  </strong></dt>
<dl>     Displays individual slices on a single image window. Slices are updated by 
         moving a slider in the GUI. </dl><p>

<li><dt><strong>MOVIE   </strong></dt>
<dl>     Shows movie of the slices in "one-way" or "two-way" mode. Delay time can be set
         using a slider.  </dl><p>

<li><dt><strong>SURFACE </strong></dt>
<dl>     Constructs and displays surface of a volume. Threshold, contribution from 
         depth versus surface reflectivity and Eulerian rotation angles can be set in the
	 GUI. Euler angle convention used are same as used in SPIDER. A movie option can 
	 be selected to display and save a sequence of frames at different thresholds or
	 at different rotation angles.   </dl><p>

</ul>
