<BODY>
 
     Interactively selects marker locations and stores locations 
relative to image in a SPIDER document file. <P>

     User is prompted for name of an image file (often one image
of a tilt series).  User is then prompted for the tilt angle 
of the image and name of a document file which will store the 
locations.   If the document file already exists, any locations
which are present in the file will be displayed on the image.
User can now pick locations of markers on the image and 
locations will be stored in the document file. <P>

     A marker numbering widget allows easy access to set the 
current marker number.  This widget is usefull when marker 
numbers are not consecutive.  The user can erase and redraw 
chosen locations. <P>

A button is available to automatically increment tilt angles
and file names in preparation for the next image in a series. <P>

     Data is stored in the document file whenever a point is 
selected.  To remove a marker which has already been selected 
it is necessary to edit the document file. <P>
