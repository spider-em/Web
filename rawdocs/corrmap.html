<H3>Correspondence map</H3> 
 
Displays a correspondence map containing numerical labels
for images on the screen. The user can then draw a polygon 
enclosing a group of image numbers. The average of the group of images
contained within the polygon can be displayed, and the average image
can stored in a file.  
The average image display can be temporary or permanent. 
Additionally a list of the image numbers in the group can be
saved to a document file.
