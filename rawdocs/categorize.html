<h3>Interactively categorize images from an image montage.</h3>

Displays montage of images.  The montage can be created from:

<dl>
<dt> A series of sequentially named images. </dt>
<dd> Web Asks for beginning image file name.  Then Web asks
     for the Last File number in the montage.  One can optionally
     specify the starting location for the first image and the
     number of frames (images) displayed on a row. Note: This
     does not work for a series of stacked images. If you have
     stacked images use the next option.  If you do not have a
     selection document file you can create one using the SPIDER : 
     <a href="../../spider/docs/man/doccreate.html">DOC CREATE</a>
     operation.
<dd><p>

<dt> A selection document file list containing image or stacked
     image numbers.</dt>
<dd> Web Asks for document file name.  The document file
     must have the image numbers in the first register (not in the
     key).  Then Web asks for the Image file template, which is the
     template for naming the series of files whose numbers are listed
     in the selection document file.  This template can either be for a
     series of individual images or for a single stack (e.g.: AVG*** or
     avgstk@***).  One can optionally limit the range of images
     selected from the document file.  Also one can optionally specify
     the starting location for the first image and the number of frames
     (images) displayed on a row.  <dd> </dl>

<p>
     Web now asks for an output SPIDER document file name.  The
     categorizations will be written into this file.  Web also asks the
     starting key number for the document file and the number of
     categories which can be assigned.</p>

<p>  User can now assign a category to any image in the 
     montage by using the left mouse button to select images.  
     The current 
     category number is toggled using the middle mouse button.
     The image file numbers and their corresponding categories are 
     stored in a document file.
