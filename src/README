1.      WEB is a point-and-click interface for display and 
     interaction with SPIDER images and data.  Web is written in C
     for the  MOTIF/X-WINDOW system.  This is an early distribution
     which is under active development and we invite comments on 
     bugs or performance issues.

        The WEB executable binary should run on SGI machines.  
     If you have a  non-SGI computer you will need MOTIF development
     software  on your computer to be able to recompile and link the 
     MOTIF based WEB code.     
      
2.   INSTALLATION OF THE WEB MODULE.

  A. LOADING THE TAPE
     Code is distributed on QIC 150 tapes in tar format.
     To load the tape use the following commands:

     cd PARENT-DIR.     (where PARENT-DIR is parent for desired 
                         location of WEB)
     mkdir web          (creates a new sub-directory for WEB)
     tar xv  web        (assumes environmental variable TAPE has been 
                         defined for your system) 
      

     The web directory contains a makefile which compiles the 
     source code, places the object code in a library,  links 
     the object code, and creates an executable binary file web.
     If the executable file which we provide does not run correctly
     use the following commands:

        a)   cd YOUR-WEB_DIR
             rm web
             make
 
        b) if the executable from the above step does not run: 
             cd YOUR-WEB_DIR
             rm web.a
             make

        c) if the executable from the above step does not run and
           you are on a SGI machine contact us at address below. 

   B.  OTHER INSTALLATION TASKS
     
     a.   Place the directory YOUR_WEB_DIR in your PATH in
          your shell startup file (often .cshrc) so that
          your system can locate the executable file when
          you type web.  Alternatively you can define an
          alias for the web location.

     b.   If you have SPIDER color look-up-tables which you wish
          to use in WEB you will have to set an environment variable
          for ther location:
             setenv SPRGB_DIR  "YOUR_RGB_FILE_DIR/*.RGB"

          Sample color look-up-tables are provided in the rgb 
          sub-directory of web.


3. RUNNING WEB:
 
           web
           USE MOUSE TO SELECT MENU ITEMS FROM PULL-DOWN MENUS

           Some further information on the use of web is given
           in web.man which is currently being expanded.
